# Twitter_Analytics_Dashboard
This project is part of my internship with NULLCLASS under the program Build Real-Time Twitter Analytics Dashboard.
The goal was to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Twitter data and provides insights into tweet engagement, user interactions, and content performance.

The dashboard is designed to support business decision-making by applying custom rules, filters, and conditions beyond basic reporting.
